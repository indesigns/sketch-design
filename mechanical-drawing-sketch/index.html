<p><strong>Mechanical Drawing Sketch</strong>, While a well executed drawing with smooth lines and nice shading makes a pretty picture it may not be nearly as useful as a rough sketch that has every dimension correct. SmartDraws mechanical drawing software is fast and easy to use. The secret is in SmartDraws powerful drawing tools and rich content of templates and symbols. Comparing with mechanical drawing the use of freehand sketching in engineering communication provides the following advantages.</p>
