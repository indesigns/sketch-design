<p><strong>Cant See Drawing Sketch League</strong>, My model has a number of out of plane 2D sketches that are not visible in my drawing. I tried using different tools and different colors. I open a DXF file and copy the contents or 2D geometry from the drawing and paste it in the Model Sketch. I need a help with a simple problem as far as i think.</p>
