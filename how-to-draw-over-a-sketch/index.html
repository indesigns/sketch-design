<p>Image to Sketch AI is a free online tool that helps you make it simple to create sketch images. If you are capturing several different drawings or taking multiple photos try to keep the phone the same distance away from each drawing. Aim to get as close to the drawing as possible while still capturing the entire sketch within the screen. If youre tired of wasting time redrawing your entire sketch because of one line you had to change retracing walls youve already drawn to build your second floor or trying to figure out the exact order your sketcher wants you to draw. Right-click the model assembly or part node and select Get Model Sketches from the menu.</p>
